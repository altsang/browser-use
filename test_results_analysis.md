# Standee Detection Test Results Analysis

## Test Environment
- Test Date: May 13, 2025
- Test URL: https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/014/0003596440
- Azure OpenAI Configuration:
  - Endpoint: https://azureopenaiexperiments.openai.azure.com
  - API Version: 2023-12-01-preview
  - Deployment: gpt-4
  - Key: Available

## Test Results
The test encountered a persistent error with the Azure OpenAI deployment:

```
Error code: 404 - {'error': {'code': 'DeploymentNotFound', 'message': 'The API deployment for this resource does not exist. If you created the deployment within the last 5 minutes, please wait a moment and try again.'}}
```

## Analysis

### Environment Configuration
- The environment variables are correctly set and accessible to the test script
- The AKT_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY and AKT_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT variables are properly mapped to AZURE_OPENAI_KEY and AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
- The direnv configuration did not resolve the deployment issue

### Error Analysis
- The error is consistent across multiple test runs
- The error occurs during the LLM connection test, before the browser is even launched
- The specific error code (404) indicates that the requested resource (deployment) does not exist
- This is a configuration issue with the Azure OpenAI service, not with the standee detection tool itself

### Standee Detection Tool
- The standee detection tool code is correctly implemented and integrated with MCP
- The tool is properly registered in the ToolRegistry for dynamic discovery
- The tool provides the necessary metadata, capabilities, and execution methods
- The tool is designed to work with the browser context to detect standees in images

## Conclusion
The standee detection tool is properly implemented and integrated with MCP, but runtime testing could not be completed due to Azure OpenAI deployment configuration issues. The specific "gpt-4" deployment does not exist in the Azure OpenAI service, which prevents the LLM from initializing and the agent from running.

## Recommendations
1. Create a "gpt-4" deployment in the Azure OpenAI service
2. Alternatively, modify the test script to use an existing deployment name
3. Wait at least 5 minutes after creating a new deployment before testing again
4. Verify the deployment exists using the Azure portal or API before testing
