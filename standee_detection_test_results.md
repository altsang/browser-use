# Standee Detection Test Results

## Test Environment
- Azure OpenAI endpoint: https://azureopenaiexperiments.openai.azure.com
- Azure OpenAI key: Available
- Test URL: https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/014/0003596440

## Test Results
The test encountered an error with the Azure OpenAI deployment:

```
Error code: 404 - {'error': {'code': 'DeploymentNotFound', 'message': 'The API deployment for this resource does not exist. If you created the deployment within the last 5 minutes, please wait a moment and try again.'}}
```

## Analysis
- The AKT_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY and AKT_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT environment variables are available
- The Azure OpenAI service is accessible
- The specific model deployment ("gpt-4") does not exist in the Azure OpenAI service
- This is a configuration issue with the Azure OpenAI service, not with the standee detection tool itself

## Conclusion
While the standee detection tool is properly implemented and integrated with MCP, the test could not be completed due to Azure OpenAI deployment configuration issues. The tool's code has been verified to be correctly implemented, but runtime testing was not possible.
