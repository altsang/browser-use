# Standee Detection Branch Verification

## Fork Synchronization
- The fork cannot be synced with the upstream repository
- This was verified using `git fetch upstream && git merge-base --is-ancestor upstream/main origin/main`

## Playwright Capabilities
- The fork retains full Playwright capabilities for rich website interaction
- advance.py utilizes advanced features including:
  - CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) integration
  - Headless/non-headless browser modes
  - Complex DOM interactions and Korean text selection
  - Frame navigation and screenshot capabilities

## MCP Tool Integration
- Tools are properly integrated via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- The standee detection tool implements MCPToolBase from mcp_protocol.py
- It's registered in the ToolRegistry for dynamic discovery
- It provides proper metadata, capabilities, and execution methods

## Standee Detection Implementation
- The standee module is properly coded as a tool through MCP
- It uses YOLOv8 for standee detection (model at models/yolov8/runs/standee_detection_train/weights/best.pt)
- It provides detection methods for both image URLs and image bytes
- It includes adaptive capabilities based on context

## Environment Verification
- All required AKT secrets are available:
  - AKT_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY
  - AKT_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
  - AKT_GH_PAT
- Azure OpenAI deployment issue:
  - While the credentials are available, the specific model deployment ("gpt-4") does not exist
  - This is a configuration issue with the Azure OpenAI service

## Test Results
- Attempted to test the standee detection tool with the Naver news website
- Test failed due to Azure OpenAI deployment configuration issues
- See [standee_detection_test_results.md](./standee_detection_test_results.md) for details

## Verification Status
- ✅ Playwright capabilities retained
- ✅ MCP integration for dynamic tool discovery
- ✅ Standee detection implementation through MCP
- ✅ Required secrets available
- ❌ Fork synchronization with upstream (cannot be synced)
- ❌ Runtime testing with Azure OpenAI (deployment not configured)
